export const baseText = "I am a Developer experienced with React, HTML, and CSS on the front end, and Node on the back end, including the deployment of REST API’s.  I’m a dedicated team player who has coded solo and in Agile settings. Never content with my current knowledge, I’ve recently picked up some Python/Django and am currently experimenting with using Context and Suspense with Hooks in React in lieu of Redux. Furthermore, years of experience working with clients in creative fields has given me the people skills required to make collaboration an enjoyable and productive endeavor.  Projects I have worked on demonstrate the value I can add based on my technical experience: I am currently building the second version of a web app that integrates API calls and web scraping to find users the best deals on collectable LP’s in the Discogs.com Marketplace.  In May I built a website for a charity beard-shaving event for restaurant workers in Baltimore with React; it involved some tricky CSS to responsively maintain the designer’s vision of a tournament bracket. For that one, I did something new to me; I used a Google Sheet as the back end to make it user friendly for the non-technical people doing data entry. The event ultimately raised over $5000, which seems not too bad for one guy shaving on a web stream. A larger project I’ve been contributing to is The Covid Tracking Project, an open source data collection and visualization project affiliated with the Atlantic magazine which has given me an introduction to Gatsby and D3. Another relevant project: On a team earlier this year, we built a public API for researchers to access information about arrests in Multnomah County. To do this, we are continually scraping data from the Sheriff's website and storing it in our own database. The projects I've worked on have included version control via Github, testing with Jest and Supertest, continuous integration with Travis, and project management using Trello, Notion, and Github Issues. Previous to coding, I accumulated years of professional experience as an Audio Engineer. Touring with rock bands gave me an unparalleled appreciation for teamwork, dedication, and creative problem solving. My education was at Hampshire College in Amherst, MA.  It is a non-traditional program which is entirely self-motivated.  My experience there launched my insatiable quest to Get Stuff Done which powered me for several decades of self-employment and has never waned.  In my Audio Engineering days, my career in the abstract was really about helping people. The fact that Oregon Mutual is about doing that same thing in a concrete way is very compelling to me.  I have a passion for code, and for learning, but I think the most valuable professional skills I can bring to the table are a relentless focus on teamwork and an ability to communicate with all stakeholders to develop a vision and translate that into an inspiring and technically excellent product.
