        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days bring the passion for craftsmanship
        and collaboration that made me successful in that field to software
        development. I have a relentless curiosity tempered by an ability to
        focus on the task at hand. An uncanny dedication to teamwork forged by
        years on the road and in the studio has given me the ability to
        communicate with all stakeholders to develop a vision and translate that
        into an inspiring and technically excellent product.
